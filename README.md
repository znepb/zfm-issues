znepb's Food Mod is a survival food mod for Fabric, a Minecraft mod loader. 

## Issues & Pull Requests
Please report any issues if you find one. I'll try to fix them asap. With regards to pull requests, I'm always listening to feedback and ideas for new foods and features. As with this, please note I am a beginner to the Fabric modding API and Java in general.

## Use the mod
zfm currently requires any 1.16 version, and requires Fabric loader >=1.10.6 (Build 214). You can download the mod from the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/znepbs-food-mod) or from the Releases tab. If you want to use this in your modpack, feel free to! Credit is not required, but I'd appreciate it.
